Random Boolean Networks

N - Number of nodes
K - Number of input per node
P - Array containing parents of each node (needs to be of length N and each P[i] needs to be of length K)
F - Update functions (needs to be of length N where each F[i] represents update function of i node; F[i] needs to be of length $2^K$)
